## Overview

This documentation summarizes the setup and configuration for a React application integrated with MongoDB, Express, Cloudinary, and Google Maps. The app features user authentication and authorization, and is hosted with Render (backend) and Netlify (frontend).

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based)
- Cloudinary account and API Key
- Google Maps API Key

## Backend Setup

### Express Server

1. **Install Dependencies**: Use `npm install` to add necessary packages in the `backend` directory.
2. **Configure Server**: Set up the Express server to connect with MongoDB, handle routes, and integrate with Cloudinary for image uploads.

### MongoDB Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**: Define MongoDB URI, Cloudinary credentials, and JWT secret in the `.env` file.
2. **User Model**: Create a Mongoose model for user management.

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **Authentication Routes**: Implement endpoints for user registration and login, using JWT for secure authentication.

### Cloudinary Integration

1. **Image Uploads**: Configure Cloudinary in the backend to handle image uploads and storage. Ensure Cloudinary credentials are securely managed through environment variables.

## Frontend Setup

### React Application

1. **Install Dependencies**: Use `npm install` to add required packages in the `frontend` directory.
2. **Configure App**: Set up routing, authentication context, and Google Maps integration in `App.js`.

### Google Maps Integration

1. **Map Component**: Use `@react-google-maps/api` to embed Google Maps in the `MapPage` component.
2. **Environment Variables**: Store the Google Maps API key in the `.env` file.

## Deployment

### Backend (Render)

1. **Deploy Backend**: Push your backend code to Render. Configure Render to use environment variables from `.env`.

### Frontend (Netlify)

1. **Deploy Frontend**: Push your frontend code to Netlify. Configure Netlify to use the environment variables for Google Maps API key and other settings.

## Running the Application

1. **Start Backend Server**: Deploy the backend on Render.
2. **Start React Application**: Deploy the frontend on Netlify.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT.

## Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB Issues**: Ensure MongoDB is accessible and the URI in `.env` is correct.
- **Cloudinary Issues**: Verify Cloudinary credentials and check the image upload settings.
- **Google Maps**: Confirm the API key is correct and enabled for the required services.
- **Authentication Errors**: Check user credentials and JWT setup.
- **Deployment Issues**: Ensure environment variables are correctly configured on Render and Netlify.
